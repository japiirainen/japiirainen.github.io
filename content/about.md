# About me

My name is Joona Piirainen, and I write [a lot of software](https://github.com/japiirainen). I currently live in Helsinki, Finland.

I work as a software engineer [@Reaktor](https://reaktor.com). At work I work mostly on web applications, both
on the front and the backend. Outside of work I'm interested in functional programming, maths and programming
language research among other things.
